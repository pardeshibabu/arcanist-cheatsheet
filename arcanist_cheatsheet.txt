1) create tasks T{NNNN} asign them
2) create a branch with name like "T{NNNN}-boo-hoo"
	$ git checkout -b T1234-boo-foo
3) commit changes on that branch until it gets ready to be reviewed
	$ git commit -am 'first'
	$ git commit -am 'now it works'
4) check if it's lint free (NOTE: it runs lint against only modified files)
	$ arc lint
5) push a review request to the server. This will create a diff with id D{NNNN}
	$ arc diff
6) As a reviewer, you can apply the changeset on your local by using arc patch D{NNNN}
	$ arc patch D5678
7) if reviewers post a comment and you need to update the changeset, commit more changes on that branch
   and push updated changeset to the server
 	
	$ arc diff --update 1234
8) To check status of review requests which you have posted, run arc list which will give you a list of Status, Diff ID and title
	$ arc list
9) Once review request got accepted, merge changes to master. "arc land" command will take care of merging/rebasing branch and          deleting your working branch... And pushing changes to origin/master.
	$ arc land
